As a special exception, if other files instantiate templates or use macros or 
inline functions from Jem files, or you compile a Jem file and link it with other 
works to produce a work based on a Jem file, the Jem file does not by itself cause 
the resulting work to be covered by the GNU General Public License. However the

section (3) of the GNU General Public License.

This exception does not invalidate any other reasons why a work based on Jem
files might be covered by the GNU General Public License.
